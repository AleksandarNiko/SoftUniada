SoftUniada is a competition for pupils, students and working people who are involved in programming. 
The format enables SoftUni students to benchmark knowledge and skills with their peers from other schools, 
universities and private initiatives, exchange experiences and good practices, and develop important teamwork and project advocacy skills.
And above all, it creates an opportunity to have fun while developing.

Well, this repo contains the solutions for the tasks from SoftUniada 2024, in which I participated and was in the top 20.
